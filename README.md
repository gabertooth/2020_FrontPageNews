# 2020_FrontPageNews

In the past decade the media has changed immensly some for the better and others for the worst. In this project, we will be dissecting and comparing the front pages of many reputable news sources. I have always loved reading different news articles from a vairaty sources like the Wall Street Journal and Reddit. However over the last four years and really the last couple months I have been taken about by the headlines on many news outlets websites.

Hopefully through the analysis in the following Jupyter notebooks I will be able to give people a unbiased look into just how unbiased some of these newspapers/media outlets are. In addition, a section will be conducted on the difference in presidency to compare the Trump vs. Obama headlines to see if there is any difference in coverage. 

Politics aside a majority of the analysis will be on the following publications home page websites:
  1. Wall Street Journal
  2. CNN
  3. Fox News
  4. Reuters
  5. Washington Post
  6. New York Times
  7. Atlantic
  8. Bloomberg
  9. Huff Post
  10. Buzz Feed
